## Data Description

The data were sourced from `tidycovid19` package which is the the R language package comes with the [Johns Hopkins](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19) and [Our World in data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data), the data of  vaccinations by age comes from [ourworldindata](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations/locations-age.csv). "peru_tidy" and "age_tidy" are both new data after steps of `select` , `left_join` and `rename` from the origin data.

## Analysis & Findings  

### COVID-19 in Latin America

```{r  latinAmerica, fig.cap="The whole pandamic in Latin America"}
library(coronavirus)
library(car)
world <- UN %>% select(region) 
colnames(world)[1] <- 'country'
world <- data.frame(country=rownames(world),world) %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
  rename(continent = country.1)



coronavirus_tidy <- coronavirus %>% 
  left_join(world, by = "country") %>% 
  filter(continent == 'Latin Amer')
  
conf_df <- coronavirus_tidy %>% 
  filter(type == "confirmed") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  arrange(-total_cases) %>%
  mutate(parents = "Confirmed") %>%
  ungroup() 
plot_ly(data = conf_df,
          type= "treemap",
          values = ~total_cases,
          labels= ~ country,
          parents=  ~parents,
          domain = list(column=0),
          name = "Confirmed",
          textinfo="label+value+percent parent") 
```
The figure \@ref(fig:latinAmerica) shows the total confirmed cases nowadays in Latine American countries, Brazil has the most cases which almost occupy the half and Peru ranked the forth at 6% among all the countries. 


```{r}
covid <- read_csv(here::here("data/owid-covid-data.csv"))
covid_peru <- covid %>% 
  filter(location == "Peru") %>% 
  mutate(date=as.Date(date)) %>% 
  select(date, new_cases, new_deaths, new_tests, total_cases, total_deaths, total_tests,
         total_tests_per_thousand, positive_rate, total_vaccinations, people_vaccinated, people_fully_vaccinated, population)
```


##  COVID-19 in Peru

### The trend of pandemic in Peru
```{r totaldeath, fig.cap="The Growth of total cases and deaths in Peru"}

peru_tidy <- covid_peru %>% 
  select(date, total_cases, total_deaths, total_vaccinations) %>% 
  rename("Total Deaths" = total_deaths,
         "Confirmed" = total_cases, 
         "Total Vaccinations" = total_vaccinations) 

peru_tot <- peru_tidy %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`Total Deaths`,Confirmed, `Total Vaccinations`), 
               names_to = "metric",   
               values_to = "Number") %>%

       x = ' ', 
       y = 'Number (Million)') +
  theme(axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(size = 15,
                                          face = "bold"),
        axis.title.y.left = element_text(size = 10,
                                         face = "bold"),
        axis.text.y.left = element_text(size = 8,
                                        face = "bold"),

  theme_economist() 

peru_tot
```

The figure \@ref(fig:totaldeath) illustrate the trend of the total cases, deaths and vaccinations from 2020 t0 2010, it is not hard to find that despite the growth rate of confirmed cases is more than taht of deaths, the total vaccination overtook the total cases and more and more people received the vaccine in 1st May 2021.



### The total cases and deaths in Peru

```{r totca, fig.cap="The trend of total cases in Peru from 2020 to 2021"}



peru_cases_week <- peru_tidy %>% 
  select(date, Confirmed) %>% 
  mutate(week = floor_date(date, "week")) %>% 
  group_by(week, Confirmed) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Confirmed))

peru_deaths_week <- peru_tidy %>% 
  select(date, `Total Deaths`) %>% 
  mutate(week = floor_date(date, "week")) %>% 
  group_by(week, `Total Deaths`) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(`Total Deaths`))



peru_cases_line <- peru_tidy %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = date,
             y = Confirmed), 
           fill = "#FF99CC", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_line(data = peru_cases_week,
            aes(x = week,
                y = mean),
            color = "#CC0000") + 
  scale_x_date(breaks = "3 months") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + 
  labs(title = "The trend of total cases in Peru",
       x = "",
       y = "") +
  annotate("text",
           x = as.Date("2021-06-30"),
           y = 1700000,
           label = "week average",
           color = "#CC0000") + 
  theme_economist() 
ggplotly(peru_cases_line)
```

```{r totde, fig.cap="The trend of total deaths in Peru from 2020 to 2021"}
peru_deaths_line <- peru_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date,
             y = `Total Deaths`)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#996666", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_line(data = peru_deaths_week,
            aes(x = week,
                y = mean),
            color = "#663300") +

           x = as.Date("2021-06-30"),
           y = 220000,
           label = "week average",
           color = "#CC0000") + 
  theme_economist() 
ggplotly(peru_deaths_line) 
```
As the figure \@ref(fig:totca) and figure \@ref(fig:totde) shows, both total confirmed cases and deaths had a climb trend. However, the total number of the cases are more than 10 times higher than the latter. Interestingly, the both growth rates experienced slowing down from 30th Aug 2020 to 17th Jan 2021, which might because the effective prevention and control of the epidemic during this time period. In addition, one thing we should concentrate on is that such a death number seems not so much around the world, but compared with the local population, it cannot be ignored that the death rate from COVID-19 is extremely serious, almost ranked the first worldwide.


## Data Story 1

### Serious deaths situation

```{r newde, fig.cap="The trend of daily new deaths in Peru from 2020 to 2021"}

peru_newde_week <- covid_peru %>% 
  select(date, new_cases) %>% 
  mutate(week = floor_date(date, "week")) %>% 
  group_by(week, new_cases) %>%
  summarise(mean = sum(new_cases))

peru_new <- covid_peru %>% 
  filter(new_cases >= 0) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = date, 
                y = new_cases), 
            size = 0.7,
            color = "red") +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, 
                y = new_cases), 
            color = "pink") + 
 # geom_line(data = peru_newde_week, 
   #         aes(x = week, 
   #             y = mean)) +
  gghighlight(new_cases > 16625, label_key = date) +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "The trend of daily new deaths in Peru",
       x = "Date",
       y = "New Death Number")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold", color = "black")) + 
  theme_economist() 
  ggplotly(peru_new) 
  

```
The figure \@ref(fig:newde), We can intuitively find that Peru has the highest daily new death toll (about 20,000) at the time points around 2020.8.2 and 2021.5.8. Even more telling is that Peru has the highest death rate from COVID-19 in the world, which can be attributed to the failure of vaccination and lack of medical resources by 2020. However, it is hard to understand why the number of deaths broke the record three months later, since the vaccine was already in use after February 15, 2012. Through the interpretation of relevant information, the emergence of the original new coronavirus variant is considered to be one of the reasons for the severe situation in Peru. On May 25, local time, the National Institute of Health (INS) of the Ministry of Health of Peru pointed out that the C.37 new crown variant virus was found in 19 regions of Peru, and the variant was first discovered in Lima, Peru. 

In fact, the poverty problem in Peru has also exacerbated the spread of the new crown virus to some extent. Al Jazeera pointed out that 70% of Peru’s workforce is “informally hired.” They often need to violate public health restrictions or they will go hungry.

Lack of income makes it difficult for people to improve their housing environment. Generations of people are crowded in small spaces. Once someone is infected with the new crown, the chance of the virus spreading in the family is very high.

In addition, Peru’s healthcare system is overwhelmed. In April alone, there were 2,000 people on the waiting list for intensive care beds across Peru, and many Peruvians had no choice but to take care of confirmed patients at home. However, self-treatment is not the answer after all. The lack of proper medical supervision is likely to make the patient's condition worse.


## Data Story 2

### Vaccination status

```{r vacage, fig.cap="Vaccination percentage by age in Peru in 2021"}
age <- read_csv(here::here("data/covid-vaccine-by-age.csv"))
age_tidy <- age %>% 
  filter(Entity == "Peru") %>% 
  select(1:3, `0-17_start`, `18-24_start`, `25-49_start`, `50-59_start`, `60-69_start`, `70-79_start`, `80+_start`) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:10, names_to = "age", values_to = "percent") %>% 
  select(-Code) %>% 
  mutate(age = str_remove(age, "_start")) %>% 
  rename(entity = Entity, 
         date = Day)

age_fig <- age_tidy %>% 
  #group_by(date, age) %>%
  #mutate(percent = sum(production)) %>%
 # ungroup(year) %>%
  #distinct(year, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
 # ungroup(crop_oil) %>%
 # select(year, crop_oil, production) %>%
 # mutate(crop_oil = fct_relevel(crop_oil, "Palm", "Soybean", "Rapeseed", "Sunflower", "Other")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date,
             y = percent,
             fill = fct_rev(reorder(age, percent)))) +
  geom_area()+
  scale_y_continuous() + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=NULL)) + 
  #scale_y_continuous()+
  labs(title = "Vaccination percentage by age in Peru",
       subtitle = "",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Vaccination percentage", fill = age)+
  scale_colour_brewer("", palette = "Dark2") + 
  theme_economist() 


ggplotly(age_fig)

```

The figure \@ref(fig:vacage) shows the trend of the proportion of people in each age group who were vaccinated in that age group under different age groups. Even if the death situation in Peru is extremely dangerous, the good news is that the number of local vaccinations is increasing day by day, and a large proportion of people of all ages are vaccinated, and even this proportion has increased exponentially. At the same time, except for those aged 0-17, the proportion of people in other age groups being vaccinated is similar to each other, basically achieving a ratio of 80% on the day of 201.8.23. This not only reflects the fairness of resources for vaccination, but also demonstrates timely measures to resolve the epidemic. Combined with the death chart above, we have reason to believe that Peru’s slowing down of the epidemic diagnosis rate and mortality rate in the second half of 2021 is inseparable from the timely and large-scale vaccination of the vaccine and the government’s reasonable response to the new infection strain initiatively.

In addition, the Ministry of Health has emphasized that the new crown vaccine being used in Peru is effective against the variant strain reported by India. The second wave of the epidemic in Peru is easing, and the number of hospitalizations has fallen sharply, especially among the elderly who have given priority to vaccination. This shows that vaccines are working.
