## Bio

Hello, I am Ori, as an international student from China, I have been 5 years learning Finance and mathematics. And now I continue my graduate degree in Monash and I like the master of Business Analytics, which provide me more resource and tools for my programming aimed on data. Of course, I prefer to do sketching and playing the piano in my spare time. Hope I can always keep the enthusiasm of arts and learning into my life!
